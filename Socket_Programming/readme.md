s.recv() :-

    In the context of socket programming in Python, s.recv() is a method used to receive data from a connected socket. It is used on the receiving end of a connection, typically by the server or the client, to read data sent by the other side of the connection.
    data = s.recv(bufsize)
    s is the socket object.
    bufsize is the maximum amount of data to be received at once, specified in bytes. It is a required parameter.
